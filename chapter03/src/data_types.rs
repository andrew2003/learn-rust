/// # Data Types
///
/// Every value in Rust is of a certain data type, which tells Rust what kind of data is being
/// specified so that it knows how to work with that data. We’ll look at two data type
/// subsets: scalar and compound.
///
/// # Scalar Types
///
/// A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types: integers,
/// floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters.
///
/// # Compound Types
///
/// Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound
/// types: tuples and arrays.
